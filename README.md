### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french developper working on PHP and Symfony project since 2020.

I'm currently in a french formation in order to become software developper from 18/01/2021 to 18/01/2022 and that's why i'm searching for a block release training in CÃ´te d'Opale or Hauts-de-France area.

For this formation, I will work on your technologies, and I will learn any skills or languages that you need !

If you are interested, contact me by my email adress : hugoflahaut29@gmail.com
